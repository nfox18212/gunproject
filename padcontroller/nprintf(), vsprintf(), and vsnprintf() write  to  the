[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The functions in the [1mprintf[22m() family produce output according to a [4mformat[24m as described below.   The  func‐
       tions  [1mprintf[22m() and [1mvprintf[22m() write output to [4mstdout[24m, the standard output stream; [1mfprintf[22m() and [1mvfprintf[22m()
       write output to the given output [4mstream[24m; [1msprintf[22m(), [1msnprintf[22m(), [1mvsprintf[22m(), and [1mvsnprintf[22m() write  to  the
       character string [4mstr[24m.

       The  function  [1mdprintf[22m() is the same as [1mfprintf[22m() except that it outputs to a file descriptor, [4mfd[24m, instead
       of to a [1mstdio[22m(3) stream.

       The functions [1msnprintf[22m() and [1mvsnprintf[22m() write at most [4msize[24m bytes (including  the  terminating  null  byte
       ('\0')) to [4mstr[24m.

       The  functions  [1mvprintf[22m(), [1mvfprintf[22m(), [1mvdprintf[22m(), [1mvsprintf[22m(), [1mvsnprintf[22m() are equivalent to the functions
       [1mprintf[22m(), [1mfprintf[22m(), [1mdprintf[22m(), [1msprintf[22m(), [1msnprintf[22m(), respectively, except that they are  called  with  a
       [4mva_list[24m instead of a variable number of arguments.  These functions do not call the [4mva_end[24m macro.  Because
       they invoke the [4mva_arg[24m macro, the value of [4map[24m is undefined after the call.  See [1mstdarg[22m(3).

       All of these functions write the output under the control of a [4mformat[24m string that specifies how subsequent
       arguments  (or  arguments accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of [1mstdarg[22m(3)) are converted
       for output.

       C99 and POSIX.1-2001 specify  that  the  results  are  undefined  if  a  call  to  [1msprintf[22m(),  [1msnprintf[22m(),
       [1mvsprintf[22m(),  or  [1mvsnprintf[22m()  would cause copying to take place between objects that overlap (e.g., if the
       target string array and one of the supplied input arguments refer to the same buffer).  See CAVEATS.

   [1mFormat of the format string[0m
       The format string is a character string, beginning and ending in its initial shift  state,  if  any.   The
       format  string  is  composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not [1m%[22m), which are copied un‐
       changed to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results  in  fetching  zero  or
       more  subsequent arguments.  Each conversion specification is introduced by the character [1m%[22m, and ends with
       a [4mconversion[24m [4mspecifier[24m.  In between there may be (in this order) zero or more [4mflags[24m, an  optional  minimum
       [4mfield[24m [4mwidth[24m, an optional [4mprecision[24m and an optional [4mlength[24m [4mmodifier[24m.

       The overall syntax of a conversion specification is:

           %[$][flags][width][.precision][length modifier]conversion

       The  arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier.  By default,
       the arguments are used in the order given, where each '*' (see [4mField[24m [4mwidth[24m and [4mPrecision[24m below)  and  each
       conversion  specifier  asks for the next argument (and it is an error if insufficiently many arguments are
       given).  One can also specify explicitly which argument is taken, at each place where an argument  is  re‐
       quired,  by writing "%m$" instead of '%' and "*m$" instead of '*', where the decimal integer [4mm[24m denotes the
       position in the argument list of the desired argument, indexed starting from 1.  Thus,

           printf("%*d", width, num);

       and

           printf("%2$*1$d", width, num);

       are equivalent.  The second style allows repeated references to the same argument.  The C99 standard  does
       not  include  the style using '$', which comes from the Single UNIX Specification.  If the style using '$'
       is used, it must be used throughout for all conversions taking an argument and all width and precision ar‐
       guments, but it may be mixed with "%%" formats, which do not consume an argument.  There may be no gaps in
       the numbers of arguments specified using '$'; for example, if arguments 1 and 3 are specified, argument  2
       must also be specified somewhere in the format string.

       For some numeric conversions a radix character ("decimal point") or thousands' grouping character is used.
       The  actual  character  used depends on the [1mLC_NUMERIC [22mpart of the locale.  (See [1msetlocale[22m(3).)  The POSIX
       locale uses '.' as radix character, and does not have a grouping character.  Thus,

           printf("%'.2f", 1234567.89);

       results in "1234567.89" in the POSIX locale, in "1234567,89" in the nl_NL locale, and in "1.234.567,89" in
       the da_DK locale.

   [1mFlag characters[0m
       The character % is followed by zero or more of the following flags:

       [1m#      [22mThe value should be converted to an "alternate form".  For [1mo [22mconversions, the  first  character  of
              the  output string is made zero (by prefixing a 0 if it was not zero already).  For [1mx [22mand [1mX [22mconver‐
              sions, a nonzero result has the string "0x" (or "0X" for [1mX [22mconversions) prepended to it.  For [1ma[22m, [1mA[22m,
              [1me[22m, [1mE[22m, [1mf[22m, [1mF[22m, [1mg[22m, and [1mG [22mconversions, the result will always contain a decimal point, even if no digits
              follow it (normally, a decimal point appears in the results of those conversions only  if  a  digit
              follows).   For  [1mg  [22mand [1mG [22mconversions, trailing zeros are not removed from the result as they would
              otherwise be.  For [1mm[22m, if [4merrno[24m contains a valid error code, the output of [4mstrerrorname_np(errno)[24m is
              printed; otherwise, the value stored in [4merrno[24m is printed as a decimal number.   For  other  conver‐
              sions, the result is undefined.

       [1m0      [22mThe value should be zero padded.  For [1md[22m, [1mi[22m, [1mo[22m, [1mu[22m, [1mx[22m, [1mX[22m, [1ma[22m, [1mA[22m, [1me[22m, [1mE[22m, [1mf[22m, [1mF[22m, [1mg[22m, and [1mG [22mconversions, the
              converted value is padded on the left with zeros rather than blanks.  If the [1m0 [22mand [1m- [22mflags both ap‐
              pear,  the  [1m0  [22mflag is ignored.  If a precision is given with an integer conversion ([1md[22m, [1mi[22m, [1mo[22m, [1mu[22m, [1mx[22m,
              and [1mX[22m), the [1m0 [22mflag is ignored.  For other conversions, the behavior is undefined.

       [1m-      [22mThe converted value is to be left adjusted on the field boundary.  (The default is right justifica‐
              tion.)  The converted value is padded on the right with blanks, rather than on the left with blanks
              or zeros.  A [1m- [22moverrides a [1m0 [22mif both are given.

       [1m' '    [22m(a space) A blank should be left before a positive number (or empty string) produced  by  a  signed
              conversion.

       [1m+      [22mA  sign  (+  or -) should always be placed before a number produced by a signed conversion.  By de‐
              fault, a sign is used only for negative numbers.  A [1m+ [22moverrides a space if both are used.

       The five flag characters above are defined in the C99 standard.  The Single UNIX  Specification  specifies
       one further flag character.

       [1m'      [22mFor  decimal  conversion ([1mi[22m, [1md[22m, [1mu[22m, [1mf[22m, [1mF[22m, [1mg[22m, [1mG[22m) the output is to be grouped with thousands' grouping
              characters if the locale information indicates any.  (See [1msetlocale[22m(3).)  Note that  many  versions
              of [1mgcc[22m(1) cannot parse this option and will issue a warning.  (SUSv2 did not include [4m%'F[24m, but SUSv3
              added  it.)  Note also that the default locale of a C program is "C" whose locale information indi‐
              cates no thousands' grouping character.  Therefore, without a prior call to [1msetlocale[22m(3), no  thou‐
              sands' grouping characters will be printed.

       glibc 2.2 adds one further flag character.

       [1mI      [22mFor decimal integer conversion ([1mi[22m, [1md[22m, [1mu[22m) the output uses the locale's alternative output digits, if
              any.   For  example,  since glibc 2.2.3 this will give Arabic-Indic digits in the Persian ("fa_IR")
              locale.

   [1mField width[0m
       An optional decimal digit string (with nonzero first digit) specifying a minimum field width.  If the con‐
       verted value has fewer characters than the field width, it will be padded with  spaces  on  the  left  (or
       right,  if  the left-adjustment flag has been given).  Instead of a decimal digit string one may write "*"
       or "*m$" (for some decimal integer [4mm[24m) to specify that the field width is given in the next argument, or in
       the [4mm[24m-th argument, respectively, which must be of type [4mint[24m.  A negative field width is taken as a '-' flag
       followed by a positive field width.  In no case does a nonexistent or small field width  cause  truncation
       of  a field; if the result of a conversion is wider than the field width, the field is expanded to contain
       the conversion result.

   [1mPrecision[0m
       An optional precision, in the form of a period ('.')  followed by an optional decimal digit  string.   In‐
       stead  of  a  decimal digit string one may write "*" or "*m$" (for some decimal integer [4mm[24m) to specify that
       the precision is given in the next argument, or in the [4mm[24m-th argument, respectively, which must be of  type
       [4mint[24m.   If  the precision is given as just '.', the precision is taken to be zero.  A negative precision is
       taken as if the precision were omitted.  This gives the minimum number of digits to appear for [1md[22m, [1mi[22m, [1mo[22m, [1mu[22m,
       [1mx[22m, and [1mX [22mconversions, the number of digits to appear after the radix character for [1ma[22m, [1mA[22m, [1me[22m, [1mE[22m,  [1mf[22m,  and  [1mF[0m
       conversions,  the  maximum  number of significant digits for [1mg [22mand [1mG [22mconversions, or the maximum number of
       characters to be printed from a string for [1ms [22mand [1mS [22mconversions.

       SUSv3 specifies all of the above, except for those modifiers explicitly noted as being nonstandard  exten‐

       As a nonstandard extension, the GNU implementations treats [1mll [22mand [1mL [22mas synonyms, so that one can, for  ex‐
       ample, write [1mllg [22m(as a synonym for the standards-compliant [1mLg[22m) and [1mLd [22m(as a synonym for the standards com‐

              number of digits that must appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it  is  padded  on
              the  left with zeros.  The default precision is 1.  When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0,
              the output is empty.

       [1mo[22m, [1mu[22m, [1mx[22m, [1mX[0m
              The [4munsigned[24m [4mint[24m argument is converted to unsigned octal ([1mo[22m), unsigned  decimal  ([1mu[22m),  or  unsigned
              hexadecimal  ([1mx [22mand [1mX[22m) notation.  The letters [1mabcdef [22mare used for [1mx [22mconversions; the letters [1mABCDEF[0m
              are used for [1mX [22mconversions.  The precision, if any, gives the minimum number of  digits  that  must
              appear; if the converted value requires fewer digits, it is padded on the left with zeros.  The de‐
              fault precision is 1.  When 0 is printed with an explicit precision 0, the output is empty.

       [1me[22m, [1mE   [22mThe  [4mdouble[24m  argument  is  rounded and converted in the style [-]d[1m.[22mddd[1me[22m±dd where there is one digit
              (which is nonzero if the argument is nonzero) before the decimal-point character and the number  of
              digits  after  it  is equal to the precision; if the precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the
              precision is zero, no decimal-point character appears.  An [1mE [22mconversion uses the letter  [1mE  [22m(rather
              than  [1me[22m) to introduce the exponent.  The exponent always contains at least two digits; if the value
              is zero, the exponent is 00.

       [1mf[22m, [1mF   [22mThe [4mdouble[24m argument is rounded and converted to decimal notation in the style [-]ddd[1m.[22mddd, where the
              number of digits after the decimal-point character is equal to the precision specification.  If the
              precision is missing, it is taken as 6; if the precision is explicitly zero, no decimal-point char‐
              acter appears.  If a decimal point appears, at least one digit appears before it.

              (SUSv2 does not know about [1mF [22mand says that character string representations for  infinity  and  NaN
              may  be  made available.  SUSv3 adds a specification for [1mF[22m.  The C99 standard specifies "[-]inf" or
              "[-]infinity" for infinity, and a string starting with "nan" for NaN, in the case of [1mf  [22mconversion,
              and "[-]INF" or "[-]INFINITY" or "NAN" in the case of [1mF [22mconversion.)

       [1mg[22m, [1mG   [22mThe  [4mdouble[24m  argument  is  converted  in style [1mf [22mor [1me [22m(or [1mF [22mor [1mE [22mfor [1mG [22mconversions).  The precision
              specifies the number of significant digits.  If the precision is missing, 6 digits  are  given;  if
              the  precision is zero, it is treated as 1.  Style [1me [22mis used if the exponent from its conversion is
              less than -4 or greater than or equal to the precision.  Trailing zeros are removed from the  frac‐
              tional part of the result; a decimal point appears only if it is followed by at least one digit.

       [1ma[22m, [1mA   [22m(C99; not in SUSv2, but added in SUSv3) For [1ma [22mconversion, the [4mdouble[24m argument is converted to hexa‐
              decimal  notation (using the letters abcdef) in the style [-][1m0x[22mh[1m.[22mhhhh[1mp[22m±d; for [1mA [22mconversion the pre‐
              fix [1m0X[22m, the letters ABCDEF, and the exponent separator [1mP [22mis used.  There is one  hexadecimal  digit
              before the decimal point, and the number of digits after it is equal to the precision.  The default
              precision  suffices  for  an exact representation of the value if an exact representation in base 2
              exists and otherwise is sufficiently large to distinguish values of type [4mdouble[24m.  The digit  before
              the  decimal  point is unspecified for nonnormalized numbers, and nonzero but otherwise unspecified
              for normalized numbers.  The exponent always contains at least one digit; if the value is zero, the
              exponent is 0.

       [1mc      [22mIf no [1ml [22mmodifier is present, the [4mint[24m argument is converted to an [4munsigned[24m [4mchar[24m, and  the  resulting
              character  is  written.   If an [1ml [22mmodifier is present, the [4mwint_t[24m (wide character) argument is con‐
              verted to a multibyte sequence by a call to the [1mwcrtomb[22m(3) function, with a conversion state start‐
              ing in the initial state, and the resulting multibyte string is written.

       [1ms      [22mIf no [1ml [22mmodifier is present: the [4mconst[24m [4mchar[24m [4m*[24m argument is expected to be a pointer to an  array  of
              character type (pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not includ‐
              ing) a terminating null byte ('\0'); if a precision is specified, no more than the number specified
              are written.  If a precision is given, no null byte need be present; if the precision is not speci‐
              fied, or is greater than the size of the array, the array must contain a terminating null byte.

              If  an  [1ml [22mmodifier is present: the [4mconst[24m [4mwchar_t[24m [4m*[24m argument is expected to be a pointer to an array
              of wide characters.  Wide characters from the array are converted to multibyte characters (each  by
              a call to the [1mwcrtomb[22m(3) function, with a conversion state starting in the initial state before the
              first wide character), up to and including a terminating null wide character.  The resulting multi‐
              byte characters are written up to (but not including) the terminating null byte.  If a precision is
              specified, no more bytes than the number specified are written, but no partial multibyte characters
              are  written.   Note  that  the precision determines the number of [4mbytes[24m written, not the number of
              [4mwide[24m [4mcharacters[24m or [4mscreen[24m [4mpositions[24m.  The array must contain a terminating null wide character, un‐
              less a precision is given and it is so small that the number of bytes written exceeds it before the
              end of the array is reached.

              integer length modifier.  No argument is converted.  (This specifier is not supported by the bionic
              C  library.)  The behavior is undefined if the conversion specification includes any flags, a field
              width, or a precision.

[1mRETURN VALUE[0m
       Upon  successful  return, these functions return the number of bytes printed (excluding the null byte used
       to end output to strings).

       The functions [1msnprintf[22m() and [1mvsnprintf[22m() do not write more than [4msize[24m bytes (including the terminating null
       byte ('\0')).  If the output was truncated due to this limit, then the return value is the number of char‐
       acters (excluding the terminating null byte) which would have been written to the final string  if  enough
       space had been available.  Thus, a return value of [4msize[24m or more means that the output was truncated.  (See
       also below under CAVEATS.)

       If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

       glibc 2.1 adds length modifiers [1mhh[22m, [1mj[22m, [1mt[22m, and [1mz [22mand conversion characters [1ma [22mand [1mA[22m.

       glibc 2.2 adds the conversion character [1mF [22mwith C99 semantics, and the flag character [1mI[22m.

       glibc 2.35 gives a meaning to the alternate form ([1m#[22m) of the [1mm [22mconversion specifier, that is [4m%#m[24m.

[1mCAVEATS[0m
       Some programs imprudently rely on code such as the following

           sprintf(buf, "%s some further text", buf);

       to  append  text  to [4mbuf[24m.  However, the standards explicitly note that the results are undefined if source
       and destination buffers overlap when calling [1msprintf[22m(), [1msnprintf[22m(), [1mvsprintf[22m(), and [1mvsnprintf[22m().   Depend‐
       ing  on  the  version  of [1mgcc[22m(1) used, and the compiler options employed, calls such as the above will [1mnot[0m
       produce the expected results.

       The glibc implementation of the functions [1msnprintf[22m() and [1mvsnprintf[22m() conforms to the  C99  standard,  that
       is,  behaves as described above, since glibc 2.1.  Until glibc 2.0.6, they would return -1 when the output
       was truncated.

[1mBUGS[0m
       Because [1msprintf[22m() and [1mvsprintf[22m() assume an arbitrarily long string, callers must be careful not  to  over‐
       flow  the  actual space; this is often impossible to assure.  Note that the length of the strings produced
       is locale-dependent and difficult to predict.  Use [1msnprintf[22m() and [1mvsnprintf[22m() instead (or [1masprintf[22m(3)  and
       [1mvasprintf[22m(3)).

       Code  such  as [1mprintf([4m[22mfoo[24m[1m); [22moften indicates a bug, since [4mfoo[24m may contain a % character.  If [4mfoo[24m comes from
       untrusted user input, it may contain [1m%n[22m, causing the [1mprintf[22m() call to write to memory and creating a secu‐
       rity hole.

[1mEXAMPLES[0m
       To print [4mPi[24m to five decimal places:

           #include <math.h>
           #include <stdio.h>
           fprintf(stdout, "pi = %.5f\n", 4 * atan(1.0));

       To print a date and time in the form "Sunday, July 3, 10:02", where [4mweekday[24m  and  [4mmonth[24m  are  pointers  to
       strings:

           #include <stdio.h>
           fprintf(stdout, "%s, %s %d, %.2d:%.2d\n",
                   weekday, month, day, hour, min);

       Many  countries  use  the day-month-year order.  Hence, an internationalized version must be able to print
       the arguments in an order specified by the format:

           #include <stdio.h>
           fprintf(stdout, format,
                   weekday, month, day, hour, min);

       where [4mformat[24m depends on locale, and may permute the arguments.  With the value:

           "%1$s, %3$d. %2$s, %4$d:%5$.2d\n"

       one might obtain "Sonntag, 3. Juli, 10:02".

       To allocate a sufficiently large string and print into it (code correct for both glibc 2.0 and glibc 2.1):

       #include <stdio.h>
       #include <stdlib.h>
       #include <stdarg.h>

       char *
       make_message(const char *fmt, ...)
       {
           int n = 0;
           size_t size = 0;
           char *p = NULL;
           va_list ap;

           /* Determine required size. */

           va_start(ap, fmt);
           n = vsnprintf(p, size, fmt, ap);
           va_end(ap);

           if (n < 0)
               return NULL;

           size = (size_t) n + 1;      /* One extra byte for '\0' */
           p = malloc(size);
           if (p == NULL)
               return NULL;

           va_start(ap, fmt);
           n = vsnprintf(p, size, fmt, ap);
           va_end(ap);

           if (n < 0) {
               free(p);
               return NULL;
           }

           return p;
       }

       If truncation occurs in glibc versions prior to glibc 2.0.6, this is treated as an error instead of  being
       handled gracefully.
